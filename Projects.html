                <p class="section_descriptions">My research focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
                    occupational
                    world, particularly the rapid acceleration of remote and hybrid work. It examines how these shifts
                    have
                    transformed traditional work structures and explores whether remote/hybrid policies are suitable for
                    businesses. The objective is to provide actionable insights for companies to make informed decisions
                    about
                    implementing such policies. This research aims to help create a more sustainable and effective work
                    environment for both employers and employees in the evolving work landscape.</p>
                <p class="section_descriptions"> The occupational world changed after the 2019 COVID pandemic. These
                    changes
                    continue to affect how we
                    operate and interact in business today. The trend towards remote work was already underway, thanks
                    to the
                    rise of telecommunications and freelance opportunities. However, the pandemic accelerated this
                    trend,
                    resulting in the widespread adoption of working from home and its transformative effects on
                    traditional work
                    structures. The research objective is to give businesses seeking to implement a remote/hybrid work
                    policy
                    indications on whether or not this type of policy would be appropriate and successful by providing
                    businesses with actionable insights to inform their decision-making regarding remote work policies,
                    ultimately fostering a more effective and sustainable work environment for both employers and
                    employees in
                    the new norm of remote work.
